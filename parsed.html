<Verse number="21">
  ¶ How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment;
  righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</Verse
><Verse number="22">
  Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</Verse
><Verse number="23">
  Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts,
  and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the
  cause of the widow come unto them.</Verse
><Verse number="24">
  Therefore saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I
  will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</Verse
><Verse number="25">
  ¶ And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take
  away all thy tin:</Verse
><Verse number="26">
  And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the
  beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the
  faithful city.</Verse
><Verse number="27">
  Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
  righteousness.</Verse
><Verse number="28">
  ¶ And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be
  together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.</Verse
><Verse number="29">
  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be
  confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</Verse
><Verse number="30">
  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no
  water.</Verse
><Verse number="31" last>
  And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall
  both burn together, and none shall quench them.</Verse

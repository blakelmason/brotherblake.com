          And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the
          Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and
          shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.

          And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
          mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will
          teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion
          shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

        Many church leaders and teachers have taught that this prophecy was and
        is being fulfilled by the temples we build, and especially the Salt Lake
        City temple. This idea has been emphasized so much that most church
        members seem unaware of the true future fulfillment of this prophecy.
        The true fulfillment takes place at the second coming in Jerusalem, as
        stated in verse 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        The temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are{' '}
        <em>parallel</em> fulfillments to this prophecy, but their construction
        is not <em>the</em> fulfillment. Now, it is good to "liken" Isaiah's
        prophecies to ourselves, but we should falso seek an understanding of
        the true fulfillment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church even made a movie called{' '}
        <Link2 href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkxbMzmWFJQ">
          Mountain of the Lord
        </Link2>{' '}
        about the Salt Lake Temple, and in the{' '}

        Wilford Woodruff declared that the building of the temples is the
        fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy. This is not wrong, in fact it is good
        to try and find parallels in our life from scripture, but again, this is
        not the true fulfillment. As stated earlier, the true fulfillment of
        this prophecy has not yet occurred and will take place after Jesus
        Christ comes again and personally reigns from Jerusalem. I found an
        excellent article titled{' '}

        Verse 2 mentions how the Lord's house will be located at the top of
        mountains and above hills. Zechariah explains how this happens.

          And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there
          be one Lord, and his name one.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="10" last>
          All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of
          Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from
          Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner
          gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king’s winepresses.

        This is a prophecy about how the land will physically change and
        Jerusalem will be physically lifted above the area around it at the
        second coming. It is symbolic of the Lord's status: because he was
        lifted up on the cross, he will be lifted and exalted above all men.
        Because he was judged of the world, all nations will flow to him in
        Jerusalem for righteous judgement and in adoration. His terrible
        condescension will be turned into a glorious ascension. The Savior
        taught this to the people in the Book of Mormon.

        Isaiah then continues and teaches what happens after the Savior comes,

        Isaiah also focuses on their prideful nature, and how all those who are
        lifted up in pride will be brought low. Just as all the land around
        Jerusalem will be made low, all men who are lifted up in pride will be
        brought low at that day.

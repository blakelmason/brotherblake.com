      <p>
        Isaiah 1 can be thought of as a prologue or thesis for the rest of the
        book of Isaiah. One of the challenges we face for studying Isaiah is the
        format of our scriptures. By forcing these writings into the typical
        chapter and verse structure, we lose some of the way Isaiah's ideas are
        meant to be organized in our mind. Isaiah 1 being more of an
        introductory chapter is a small example, but in other areas of Isaiah's
        writings this can limit our understanding if we are unaware of the
        intended organization of the presented ideas.

        commencement of his writings. The article is called{' '}

          The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
          and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings
          of Judah.
        </Verse>

      Isaiah prophesied during the reign of these 4 kings in Judah. See the
      chart below for reference.

      <p>
        Isaiah prophesied to a wicked generation, and unfortunately during his
        life he witnessed incredible destruction that was brought to pass by
        this wickedness. Much of his prophecies are full of warnings of
        destruction to the people, and desperate cries for repentance so that
        the destruction would be witheld. We immediately hear this voice of
        admonition in the next verses.

          From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in

      <p>
        Isaiah is alluding to the threat of Assyria in verse 7. During his
        lifetime, Assyria was the major superpower and the threat of destruction
        by them was very real. If we go back to the chart of kings, we see that
        during Isaiah's lifetime the kingdom of Israel was destroyed by Assyria.
        Judah was almost destroyed as well, but was miraculously saved right
        before Assyria's victory over Jerusalem. The siege of Jerusalem by
        Assyria is found later in the book of Isaiah, beginning in Isaiah 36.

        <Verse number="8" last>
          And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a
          lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
        </Verse>
      </Box>
      <p>
        The "cottage" and "lodge" are both structures which are only used to
        temporarily store produce during harvest time. Otherwise, they are a
        desolate, rundown shack that no one visits. Isaiah is using symbolism to
        describe how the Lord has forsaken them because of their wickedness,
        just like how workers leave these huts after the harvest is over.

        <Verse number="9" last>
          Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we

        </Verse>
      </Box>
      <p>
        Verse 9 is about the destruction of Judah when the Assyrians attack.
        Even though Judah was saved, only a remnant remained. See{' '}

          And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you:

        . The "sacrifices", "offerings", "new moons", "sabbaths", etc. refer to
        sacred ordinances, ceremonies, or gatherings. Our modern day equivalents
        would be sacrament meeting, temple ordinances, blessings, church
        activities, etc. Isaiah is emphasizing how they are the Lord's people
        and they perform the outward motions, but their sacred activities have
        turned into "vain oblations" because they are ignoring what really
        matters. Verses 16 - 20 explain what really matters to the Lord, and
        what the people need to do to be healed and become whole.

      <p>
        Verse 29 is about the idol worship in Judah and Israel. The "oaks" and
        "gardens" are symbols of the people worshipping false gods. The worship
        of false gods generally entailed extremely terrible actions by the
        people. See{' '}

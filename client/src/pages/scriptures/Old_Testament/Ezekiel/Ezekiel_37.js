        <Verse number="1">
          The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of
          the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of
          bones,
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="2" last>
          And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were
          very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
        </Verse>
      </Box>
      <p>
        "Very dry" means they had been dead a long time, meaning no tissues
        left.
      </p>
      <Box>
        <Verse number="3">
          And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered,
          O Lord God, thou knowest.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="4">
          Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O
          ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="5">
          Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath
          to enter into you, and ye shall live:
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="6">
          And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and
          cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye
          shall know that I am the Lord.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="7">
          So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a
          noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his
          bone.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="8">
          And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and
          the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="9">
          Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man,
          and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the four
          winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="10">
          So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and
          they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="11">
          ¶ Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of
          Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost:
          we are cut off for our parts.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="12">
          Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold,
          O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of
          your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="13">
          And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves,
          O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="14" last>
          And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place
          you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken
          it, and performed it, saith the Lord.

        These verses are about the resurrection. The Lord taught Ezekiel about
        it in a very creative way. It sounds like a movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only is this about the resurrection, but it is about the gathering
        of Israel at the second coming. At the second coming all of those who
        are of the House of Israel, who are to be resurrected in the first
        resurrection, will be brought together and will come with the Lord to
        Jerusalem. Then, they will inherit the land of Israel, the promised
        land, and live with the Lord in a powerful and peaceful paradise on the
        earth.
      </p>
      <Box>
        <Verse number="15">
          {' '}
          ¶ The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying,
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="16">
          Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For
          Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take
          another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim,
          and for all the house of Israel his companions:
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="17" last>
          And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one
          in thine hand.
        </Verse>
      </Box>
      <p>
        Most people in the church are familiar with this prophecy. We hold the
        Bible and Book of Mormon together and say how Ezekiels prophecy was
        fulfilled: the Bible as the stick of Judah and the Book of Mormon as the
        stick of Ephraim. Like{' '}
        <Link to="/scriptures/Old_Testament/Isaiah/2">Isaiah 2</Link>, this is
        not a <em>true</em> fulfillment but rather a <em>parallel</em>{' '}
        fulfillment. Also like Isaiah 2, the true fulfillment will take place at
        the second coming of Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found an anti-Mormon article titled{' '}
        <Link2 href="https://carm.org/mormonism/ezekiel-37-sticks-joseph-book-mormon">
          What does Ezekiel 37:15-17 mean when it speaks of the two sticks?
        </Link2>{' '}
        about how the church is wrong in its interpretation of this prophecy and
        I feel it is very accurate in its feelings toward how the church
        interprets scripture. The writer is incorrect in saying that this
        prophecy has nothing to do with the Book of Mormon, but he is right in
        expressing how we as a church get so caught up in the parallel
        fulfillment that we lose sight of the true fulfillment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The parallel fulfillment of the Book of Mormon coming forth{' '}
        <em>emphasizes</em> Ezekiels prophecy. Joseph Smith bringing forth the
        Book of Mormon, and joining it with the Bible is the same prophecy that
        Ezekiel made. Joseph Smith and Ezekiel both stand as prophets who are
        testifying of Jesus Christ and His second coming, and both brought forth
        the symbol of joining together Ephraim and Judah. They both are trying
        to teach us that the Lord will bring together his people in one and they
        will all be established together in the land of Israel after He comes to
        earth.
      </p>
      <p>Ezekiel explains this to the people in the next few verses.</p>
      <Box>
        <Verse number="18">
          ¶ And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying,
          Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="19">
          Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the stick
          of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel
          his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah,
          and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="20">
          ¶ And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before
          their eyes.
        </Verse>
        <Verse number="21" last>
          And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the
          children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and
          will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
        </Verse>
      </Box>
      <p>We see two things happening in verse 21.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>God takes the children of Israel from among the heathen.</li>
        <li>He then brings the children of Israel into their own land.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Number two is also mentioned in verse 14, and this is constantly being
        repeated, that the children of Israel will be established in their land.
        This will happen in the New Jerusalem, but will also happen after that
        in the old Jerusalem. Note that prophecies generally point to the
        establishment of the children of Israel in <em>Israel</em>, not in
        America where the New Jerusalem is located. In the church we are singly
        focused on the establishment of the New Jerusalem and forget that most
        scripture points to Israel and the kingdom established by the Savior
        after His second coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping in mind that these verses are about Israel, the next verse
        explains what Ezekiel meant by joining together the stick of Joseph and
        Judah.
      </p>
      <Box>
        <Verse number="22" last>
          And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of
          Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no
          more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any
          more at all:
        </Verse>
      </Box>
      <p>
        At the second coming, everyone who is part of the Church of Jesus Christ
        of Latter-day Saints will be resurrected and come with Christ to Israel.
        There, all the saints will meet the Jews and will crown them as kings
        and queens on mount Zion. This fulfills the words of Isaiah.

        This moment is the true fulfillment of the prophecy of Ezekiel, which
        has been paralleled by the prophet Joseph Smith in joining together the
        Book of Mormon and the Bible. The kingdom of Joseph, and the kingdom of
        Judah will finally be brought home to their land and be united by the
        Savior. They will be made one, and the Lord Jesus Christ will hold both
        joined nations in his hand, and will rule over them as their king.
        Ezekiel then describes this glorious day.

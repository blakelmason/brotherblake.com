          may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold

        In the Sermon on the Mount the Savior declared that we "are the light of
        the world" and commanded "let your light so shine before men" (

        I have always thought this sounded self-centered, and wondered what the
        proper balance is between holding up <em>my</em> light and keeping the
        focus on the Savior. Fortunately in 3 Nephi the Savior explains this
        teaching. He declares that <em>he</em> is our light that we should hold
        up to the world. Isn't it nice to have the Book of Mormon to clarify
        teachings? This is a small example of how the Book of Mormon is the "the
        most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and
        a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any
        other book"{' '}

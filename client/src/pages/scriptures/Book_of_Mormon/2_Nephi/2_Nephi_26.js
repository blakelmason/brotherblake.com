          After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have dwindled in
          unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the
          Lord God shall have camped against them round about, and shall have
          laid siege against them with a mount, and raised forts against them;
          and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even that
          they are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be written, and the
          prayers of the faithful shall be heard, and all those who have
          dwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten.

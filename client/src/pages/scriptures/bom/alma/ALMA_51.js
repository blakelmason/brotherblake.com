        <p>
          <strong>1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;And now it came to pass in the
          commencement of the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges
          over the people of Nephi, they having established peace between the
          people of Lehi and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and
          having commenced the twenty and fifth year in peace;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, they did not long maintain
          an entire peace in the land, for there began to be a contention among
          the people concerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were
          a part of the people who desired that a few particular points of the
          law should be altered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor
          suffer the law to be altered; therefore, he did not hearken to those
          who had sent in their voices with their petitions concerning the
          altering of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, those who were desirous that
          the law should be altered were angry with him, and desired that he
          should no longer be chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a
          warm dispute concerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass that those who were
          desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned from the judgment-seat were
          called king-men, for they were desirous that the law should be altered
          in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a king
          over the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who were desirous that Pahoran
          should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of
          freemen; and thus was the division among them, for the freemen had
          sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of
          their religion by a free government.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>7</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass that this matter of
          their contention was settled by the voice of the people. And it came
          to pass that the voice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and
          Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among
          the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who
          also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were
          obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          <strong>8</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now those who were in favor of kings
          were those of high birth, and <u>they sought to be kings</u>; and they
          were supported by those who sought power and authority over the
          people.
        </p>
      </Scripture>
      <p>
        Usually we think of one person seeking to be king, but verse 8 points
        out that many men were desirous to be "kings". I think the Book of
        Mormon is trying to warn against the principle of trying to become a
        king, not just the one political figure who actually is able to become a
        king. It is a warning against unrighteous dominion and for seeking power
        over others so that we may get gain and be "lords over God's heritage" (

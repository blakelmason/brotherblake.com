        My first update! Just to get some content going, I thought I would share
        some of the information I compiled while preparing for a lesson this
        week.

        In the October 2018 General Conference, Bishop Davies shared a talk
        titled{' '}

          "Come, Listen to a Prophet's Voice"
        </a>
        . The following video is the first few minutes of his talk where he
        shares a fun story about working with President Hinckley.
      </p>
      <Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dGt5fY_cIk8" />
      <p>
        I really enjoy the story, and I like its emphasis on the divine guidance
        that the prophet receives. After watching the video, I decided to study
        each General Conference address from the prophet over the past 2 years.
        Below is a small summary of each message since April 2017.

          "I implore each of us to prayerfully study and ponder the Book of
          Mormon each day . . . If you do not have a firm testimony of these
          things, do that which is necessary to obtain one."

          "In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually
          without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of
          the Holy Ghost".
          <br />
          "Do the spiritual work required to enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost."

          "Jesus Christ directed us to call the Church by His name because it is
          His Church, filled with His power."
          <br />
          "We must clearly acknowledge Him as the source of that power."

          "Jesus Christ invites us to take the covenant path back home to our
          Heavenly Parents and be with those we love . . . Do the spiritual work
          to find out for yourselves [that the Savior’s Church has been
          restored]."

        I felt that in these messages the prophet has been emphasizing the
        importance of personal conversion, and gaining and keeping a knowledge
        of truth through the Holy Ghost. President Nelson shared a formula to
        help with this in April 2018.

        "Nothing opens the heavens quite like the combination of increased
        purity, exact obedience, earnest seeking, daily feasting on the words of
        Christ in the Book of Mormon, and regular time committed to temple and
        family history work."

      <p>
        The words "daily feasting on the Book of Mormon" stood out to me, and
        how especially important the Book of Mormon is in the process of
        receiving the Holy Ghost.{' '}

        explains this importance, and the following are a few sentences from the
        missionary guide that I feel are appropriate to apply to ourselves.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful
          resource in conversion."
        </li>
        <li>
          "Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical
          for an enduring conversion."
        </li>
        <li>
          "Rely on the promise in Moroni 10:3–5. Every person who sincerely
          reads and prays about this book can know with certainty of its
          truthfulness by the power of the Holy Ghost."
        </li>
        <li>
          "You too should apply this promise regularly to strengthen and renew
          your own testimony of the Book of Mormon."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Scripture r="Moroni 10 : 3 - 5" />
      <p>
        These words brought questions to my mind about my studying habits of the
        Book of Mormon.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Did I read in the Book of Mormon yesterday?</li>
        <li>
          How many days did I read in the Book of Mormon this past week? Month?
          Year? Decade? Since my baptism?
        </li>
        <li>
          When I do read the Book of Mormon, how often do I prayerfully study
          and ponder what I read?
        </li>
        <li>
          When was the last time I knelt and asked God if the Book of Mormon is
          true, Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was a prophet, or the Church
          of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is God’s kingdom on earth?
        </li>
      </ul>

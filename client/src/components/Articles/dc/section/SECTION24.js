          <strong>9</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;And in temporal labors thou shalt not
          have strength, for this is not thy calling. Attend to thy calling and
          thou shalt have wherewith to magnify thine office, and to expound all
          scriptures, and continue in laying on of the hands and confirming the
          churches.

      <p>
        In this scripture the Lord explained to Joseph that his calling is not
        in temporal affairs. I had never thought of this before: that some men
        do not receive great temporal blessings because that is not their
        calling in this life. Joseph was blessed with other gifts, and he was to
        magnify those gifts rather than work toward greater temporal prosperity.
        In the world I feel an influence to always expend my efforts toward
        greater temporal prosperity, as if that is more important than anything
        else. This can be a distraction from more important things, such as
        focusing on the gifts and talents God has given me for the building up
        of Zion.
